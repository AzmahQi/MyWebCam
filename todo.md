
- [] Define the project
    - Phase 1:
        - [X] Create a script in the project directory to generate a virtual environment using .venv .
        - [X] Standardize the file structure. MUST HAVE: include a test system (tests directory and CI).
        - [X] Create a "Hello World" example for the app.
        - [] Detect the system webcam and display the camera feed on screen.
        - [] Apply an object detection system (or similar) to the live feed.
        - [] GOAL: Work in modular components so the final system can accept different inputs and outputs — e.g. live webcam, prerecorded video, 
            or a single image — and produce corresponding outputs.
